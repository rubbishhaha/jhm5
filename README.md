    open in port

## each programming language function

### web application mainly combined by client(your pc), network, and server
### html
run at client in web application, mainly for structure and wording
### css
run at client in web application, mainly for decoration
### javascript
run at client in web application, mainly for dynamic function( react to button being pressed)

### more library and function is made to reduce drawback of time required to react from server, and the low capacity of server when too many people connect to server
### js.node
efficient and stable connection
### react
with many defined function to make writing program more easier, e.g. async()
### json
let data transfer between client and server become {a:1}, just like dictionary, file become smaller
### AJAX
